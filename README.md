# SkinnerWorld

SkinnerWorld is a reinforcement learning gridworld project based on a [Skinner Box](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-skinner-box-2795875)

Four algorithms are implemented: Sample Averaging, Monte Carlo, Q learning, and SARSA.
Gridworld is implemented with a tkinter GUI
All parameters and algorithms can be defined as user inputs on the GUI or as parameters when initializing the gridworld
Gridworld provides options to save images of final Q and V value tables from the grid as well as agent data learned during training
